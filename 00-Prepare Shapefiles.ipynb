    "# Predicting Neighborhood Gentrification in London Using Machine Learning and Spatial Data\n",
    "### Zoe Papagianni(01827902)                                                    9/06/2023\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we delve into the dynamic landscape of London's urban development and explore the potential of cutting-edge techniques to forecast the areas that are likely to undergo gentrification in the future. Gentrification is the process of urban transformation characterized by the influx of wealthier residents into previously disadvantaged neighborhoods. It has garnered significant attention from researchers as it brings about profound changes in the socioeconomic fabric, housing market, and cultural dynamics of a neighborhood. Understanding and predicting gentrification can provide valuable insights for equitable urban planning, housing policy, and community development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will be centered around utilizing various types of data, including demographic information, socioeconomic indicators, housing market data, and spatial features. By combining and analyzing these datasets, we can identify key factors that contribute to the likelihood of gentrification in different neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will preprocess and integrate various datasets and perform some prelimenary exploratory data analysis to gain insights. In the next steps of this analylis, I will engineer relevant features, train and evaluate predictive models, and generate informative visualizations to depict the predicted areas of gentrification in London.\n",

    "Greater London is an administrative area  in England governed by the Greater London Authority and it is organised into 33 local government districts: the 32 London boroughs and the City of London as seen in the [image](https://hidden-london.com/miscellany/london-boroughs-map/) below the\n",

    "In this chapter, the relevant shapefiles are created by downloading data from the London Data Store. This step only needs to be run once.\n",
